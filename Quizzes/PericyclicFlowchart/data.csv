1,Are two new &sigma;-bonds formed?,Yes,No,a,Two new &sigma;-bonds and a new ring were formed at the expense of 1 &pi;-bond in this reaction.,A <em>cycloaddition</em>.

This reaction is therefore a <strong>[4+2] cycloaddition</strong>."
2,Are two new &sigma;-bonds formed?,Yes,No,b,This reaction resulted in the migration of a C-O &sigma;-bond to become a C-C bond and no net change in the number of &pi;- or &sigma;-bonds.,Is there a change in the number of &pi;-bonds?,Yes,No,,b,"The old and new s-bonds bracket two 3-heavy-atoms fragments.

This reaction is therefore a <strong>[4+2] cycloaddition</strong> 
7,Are two new &sigma;-bonds formed?,Yes,No,b,This reaction resulted in the migration of a &sigma;-bond but there is no net change in the number of &sigma;-bonds overall. ,Is there a change in the number of &pi;-bonds?,Yes,No,,b,"The total number of &pi;-bonds stays the same. The only change is the migration of a &sigma;-bond. This reaction is therefore a <strong>[3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement</strong> due to the 2 flip-flop fragments which contain 3 heavy atoms each. "
8,Are two new &sigma;-bonds formed?,Yes,No,b,"A new ring has formed at the expense of one &pi;-bond, which has been converted into a &sigma;-bond. So the answer is NO.
